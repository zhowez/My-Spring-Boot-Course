Running Neo4j Server in Docker Container

This guide will help you set up and run a Neo4j server using Docker.

Prerequisites

Docker installed on your machine. If not installed, you can download it from Docker's official website.
Build and Run the Container

docker build -t my-neo4j-server .

Replace my-neo4j-server with a name of your choice for the Docker image.

Run the Docker Container:

docker run -d -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 --name neo4j-server my-neo4j-server

This command will start the Neo4j server container in detached mode (-d) and expose ports 7474 (Neo4j browser) and 7687 (bolt protocol).

Access Neo4j Browser:

Once the container is running, you can access the Neo4j browser using your web browser:

URL: http://localhost:7474/
Username: neo4j
Password: secret (or the password you set in the Dockerfile)
Changing Default Password (For Development)

If you need to change the default password neo4j to something else, follow these steps:

Access the running Neo4j container:

docker exec -it neo4j-server bash

Inside the container, change the password using the cypher-shell:

cypher-shell -u neo4j -p neo4j

Once connected, change the password with:

ALTER USER neo4j SET PASSWORD 'new-password';
Replace 'new-password' with your desired password.

Exit the container and use the new password to log in to Neo4j Browser.

Stopping and Removing the Container

To stop and remove the Neo4j server container, use the following commands:

docker stop neo4j-server
docker rm neo4j-server
