Create a new file named Dockerfile in your working directory and add the above content to it.

- Build the Docker Image:

Open a terminal in the directory containing your Dockerfile and run the following command to build your Docker image:

RUN: docker build -t my-mongodb .

- Here, -t my-mongodb tags the image with the name my-mongodb.

Run the Docker Container:

After building the image, you can run a container using the following command:

RUN: docker run --name my-mongodb-container -d -p 27017:27017 my-mongodb

- This command runs a container named my-mongodb-container in detached mode and maps port 27017 of the container to port 27017 on the host.
